## 5️⃣ AWS Well-Architected — 6 Pillars Check

For each PR, verify if the change **upholds or degrades** these structural qualities.
Mark with `[X]` only if **explicitly reviewed** or **addressed** in this change.

| Pillar                        | Check | Reflection                                                              |
| :---------------------------- | :---: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Operational Excellence** |  [ ]  | Does this change improve observability, automation, or process clarity? |
| **2. Security**               |  [ ]  | Were credentials, policies, and data access boundaries validated?       |
| **3. Reliability**            |  [ ]  | Does it increase fault tolerance, retries, or graceful degradation?     |
| **4. Performance Efficiency** |  [ ]  | Are resources and execution time optimized for load?                    |
| **5. Cost Optimization**      |  [ ]  | Does it reduce unnecessary compute, storage, or idle usage?             |
| **6. Sustainability**         |  [ ]  | Does it minimize compute cycles, network calls, or wasteful processes?  |

> *If none of these apply, re-evaluate whether the PR meaningfully alters system structure or only its surface.*

💡 *Reminder:*  
Reflect before you merge.  
If nothing was learned, the PR was likely too automatic — or too big.
